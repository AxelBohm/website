abstract: In this work we show that various algorithms, ubiquitous in convex optimization (e.g. proximal-gradient, alternating projections and averaged projections) generate self-contracted sequences $(x_{k})_{k\in\mathbb{N}}$. As a consequence, a novel universal bound for the __length__ ($\sum_{k\ge 0}\Vert x_{k+1}-x_k\Vert$) can be deduced. In addition, this bound is independent of both the concrete data of the problem (sets, functions) as well as the stepsize involved, and only depends on the dimension of the space.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We prove the selfcontractedness of the iterates generated by the proximal gradient method, implying a universal bound on the _length_ of this sequence.
