abstract: 
  Motivated by the training of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), we study methods for solving minimax problems with additional nonsmooth regularizers.
  We do so by employing \emph{monotone operator} theory, in particular the \emph{Forward-Backward-Forward (FBF)} method, which avoids the known issue of limit cycling by correcting each update by a second gradient evaluation.
  Furthermore, we propose a seemingly new scheme which recycles old gradients to mitigate the additional computational cost.
  In doing so we rediscover a known method, related to \emph{Optimistic Gradient Descent Ascent (OGDA)}.
  For both schemes we prove novel convergence rates for convex-concave minimax problems via a unifying approach. The derived error bounds are in terms of the gap function for the ergodic iterates.
  For the deterministic and the stochastic problem we show a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\nicefrac{1}{k})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\nicefrac{1}{\sqrt{k}})$, respectively.
  We complement our theoretical results with empirical improvements in the training of Wasserstein GANs on the CIFAR10 dataset.
